# stContactList
Get list of student contacts
## Usage
- Download Python script
- From terminal/cmd, `python stContactList.py`
- Output CSV is sent to current working directory
## Dependencies
- pandas
- lxml
- requests
## Disclaimer
This script is currently written to get contact information from the JHU department of [BCMB](https://bcmb.bs.jhmi.edu/students). Could serve as a jumping off point for e.g. graduate student unions looking for an easier way to compile contact information.

The script is pretty simple, but if you represent a union and aren't familiar with programming/Python, feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
