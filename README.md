# stContactList
Get list of student contacts

## Usage
- Download Python script
- From terminal/cmd, `python stContactList.py`
- Output CSV is sent to current working directory

## Dependencies
- pandas
- lxml
- requests

## Disclaimer
This script is currently written to get student contact information from the [BCMB](https://bcmb.bs.jhmi.edu/students) graduate program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to support the mission and activities of [Teachers and Researchers United](http://trujhu.org/), the graduate student employee union. The python script contained in this repository can serve as a jumping off point for e.g. other graduate student unions looking for an easier way to compile contact information.

The script is pretty simple, but if you represent a union or similar organization and aren't familiar with programming/Python, [please feel free to contact me](mailto:connor0mason@gmail.com) if you have any questions.
